# Nifty50_Prediction

Used the LazyPredictor module to analyse and find the model with the best r2_score to predict the closing price of NSE's Nifty50 Index. The dataset is split in 7:3 for training and test. Finally used XGBoostRegressor and K-Nearest Neighbour models to predict with a r2_score of 0.94 and 0.98 respectively.
